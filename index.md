# Objectives

Students will learn the distinction between various computational models, and the relationship between these models.
Students will learn how to formally reduce one computational problem to another. They will learn to prove that a problem is NP-complete.
Students will gain an understanding of the value of randomness in computation, and they will learn to analyze simple probabilistic events.
Students will learn about interactive proof systems, and how to prove that a protocol is sound.
